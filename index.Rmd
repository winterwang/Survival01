# Aims

.full-width[.content-box-red[.bold[To introduce some of the main concepts which underlie the analysis of survival data]]]
- Describe the features of survival data
- Describe distributions of survival times
    - hazard function, survival function, and distribution functions
- Outline some particular distributions for survival times with different features
- Prepare data for survival analysis in R
- Estimate the parameters in R and interpret

# What is survival analysis?

class: middle 

# Background

.full-width[.content-box-red[.bold[Survival analysis is the **study of times** at which some outcome or event of interest occurs.]]]

- Example of outcomes of interest in survival analysis: 
  - death (all causes)
  - death following a disease diagnosis
  - diagnosis of a disease
- Terminology <br>
The time at which the event occurs is referred to as a **survival/failure/event time**.

# Examples of survival study

- .bold[Studying the patterns of survival in a given population over a particular time scale]
<br> For a person born in the UK/US/Japan in a particular year, what is the probability that the person lives to age 5, 40, 100? 
  
- .bold[Comparing survival times for individuals in two groups, or several groups.]
<br> After diagnosis, do patients receiving a new treatment have better survival prospects than patients receiving a standard treatment.

# Examples of survival study

- .bold[Studying the effects of several continuous and categorical variables on survival times, taking into account possible confounding]
<br>How is adult BMI associated with time to disease diagnosis after controlling for potential confounders?

- .bold[Predicting future survival based on features of an individual]
<br> What is the probability that an individual with features x,y,x will survive 5 years following a cancer diagnosis?

# Where do we find survival data?

- In national **registers of births and deaths**
- In **randomized controlled trials**, where it is of interest to study whether individuals with a particular medical condition who were randomized to a new treatment tended to live longer than individuals randomized to the standard treatment. 
- In **prospective observational studies (cohort studies)**

### Time scale for outcome: death from all causes

.full-width[.content-box-red[.med[Considering all causes of death in a general population, such as the UK population, the time of origin is date of birth and the survival time may be measured by age in years.]]]

### Time scale for outcome: acute graft-versus host disease following bone marrow transplantation

### Example 1.1: Survival of leukaemia patients in an observational study

![](fig/Leukaemia.png)

???
- Survival times (time to death) in weeks of 33 leukaemia patients. 
- They are divided into two groups according to a characteristics of their white blood cells (AG +/-)
- Time of origin is date of diagnosis with leukaemia, and the time scale is time in weeks since diagnosis.

## Censoring

- A particular feature that always arises in survival data from studies of human health is that not all individuals are observed to have the outcome of interest.

- We say that **their survival time is "censored"**.

.full-width[.content-box-red[**Administrative censoring**<br> .med[if individuals are followed up for the outcome "death", then we may wish to perform some analysis of the data before the point at which all members of the cohort have died.]]]

class: middle

## Other types of censoring

.full-width[.content-box-red[**Loss to follow-up** <br> .med[In both intervention studies and observational studies some individuals may be lost to follow-up, meaning that the investigators lose contact with them.]]]

.full-width[.content-box-red[**Death from other causes** <br> .med[If we are interested in time to disease diagnosis then some individuals in the study population will never be diagnosed with the disease of interest and will die from another cause.]]]

???

It is possible to have all of these types of censoring.
